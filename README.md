# D&D Action Classification

The D&D experience requires a lot of manual effort to configure the game and perform actions. D&D is a social game. Players are already talking to one another. If we can take what players say and perform some of the actions they state automatically, we can reduce the manual effort required of the game.

To this end, the D&D Action Classifier was made. It classifies spoken D&D phrases as particular actions and a program that utilizes this classifier, could theoretically, perform the spoken actions for the player. Unfortunately, the quantity of data necessary for an accurate D&D Action Classifier is not available, but this project provides a small, manually labeled D&D Action Dataset.
