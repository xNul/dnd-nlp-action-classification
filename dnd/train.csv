Let's look around. Are there any dwarves in the vicinity?,2
"Hello, friends. My associates and I were looking for a place of lodging for the night and a place of reputable reputation.",3
This is Common?,2
"Which way to the Pig Pits, sir?",3
How high is the ceiling here? Can Grog fit in here?,2
What're you looking at?,3
We grab a table next to the dwarves with Grog.,1
"Well, thank you for your hospitality. Might we inquire about staying here the night? Do you have an inn with the establishment?",3
"We might have business with you, if you've seen a halfling come through.",3
"Excuse me, one thing, Adra, are there any mystics in this particular town that study any arcane arts?",3
What time of day is it?,2
Do dwarves carry the same schedule?,2
"Yes. I would like to go up and put my scar, and post up on the bar and",1
"We were wondering if we might, perchance acquire your knowledge about town, for a bit of a search.",3
They were actually wanting to ask you a question if you wouldn't mind.,2
I reach out and I stroke his bicep because I can't hear that.,2
Would you like to accompany us on this journey that we're taking?,2
"Can I do a perception check to see if he's lying?""",2
I'm going to go walk over to Grog really quickly.,1
I put it in the bag of holding.,2
"Can I stop Adra then and ask her where Greyspine Manor is? Keep, manor, whatever.",2
How long is a short rest?,2
I want to head in that direction.,1
I'm going to House Thunderbrand before turning in this evening.,1
"So we'll take a stroll. Shop, see what the area's like.",1
"We definitely are visitors here, sir, no one has explained the rules to your city.",2
Am I currently being beaten by a whore dwarf or anything?,2
I'm going to saunter on up to the door!,1
I'm going to shoot a Fireball.,0
I use Mage Hand. I knock on the door.,0
Glacial Blast right up to the door.,0
Do I see any security details?,2
I cast a fog. Over the ring.,0
"In the fog I somersault over some random dwarf and pull out my dagger, but turn it around in my hand and whack Balgus in the back of the head as hard as I can, just to try and knock him out.",0
I start playing music from my shawm instrument.,2
I'm going to cast Prestidigitation and do fireworks on top of that.,0
"I beeline to the bar and say A large mug of ale, please.",1
I stick him in my little pocket.,2
Let's go with the storage room.,1
Do you have any flasks that we could use to fill them up?,3
Let's go knock on the door.,1
I'll start singing a little jaunty welcoming song.,2
"I will also say, could you direct us to the quarry?",3
"What was your name, again?",3
I'm going to turn invisible.,2
"My nervousness, I let out a little bit of a fart.",2
"Yeah, I'm going to try one!",2
I become un-invisible and I cast Dimension Door.,0
"Let's make our way to the mines, shall we?",1
Let's walk towards the guards.,1
I'm going to take this opportunity to cast Stoneskin on myself.,0
While he is talking I take a flask out of my cloak and approach the barrel and surreptitiously pour a little bit of it into the flask.,2
I take a shot. I shoot it!,0
I take a shot. Right now.,0
I throw a dagger.,0
"I'm going to throw a little Fireball, right there where those guys are.",0
We run straight in.,1
"I throw Entangle up, in the distance wherever they're coming from.",0
I move within 60 feet of those big fellows.,1
I'm going to shoot a Scorching Ray at the big guy.,0
"I'm going to do a Fireball instead,",0
I'm going to use my second spell and do Telekinesis and pick one up and try to hurl him into the other one.,0
I'm going to cast Hunter's Mark on the most damaged one.,0
Then I'm going to shoot Lightning Arrow.,0
I'm going to shoot Lightning Arrow at them.,0
And I would like to move to the right of all those stinking goblins!,1
"Yeah, and then I would like to give them the cleanest shave possible with my greataxe.",0
"I'm going to take a run towards my sister, since she's right close to him.",1
I do a quick sprint jog up up,1
Are there any guards around still?,2
I'm running right now diagonally towards the wall and I press against the wall.,1
"I'm breathing deep, taking aim at the wall, resetting everything.",0
Are there any dwarves that we can say to go get Ballsack and bring him down?,2
I'll move up to the right near where Grog is.,1
"Let's shoot two of them right now, right, three of them?",0
I am going to do the fire arrow thingy at it.,0
Can I turn to him and blow fire out of my nostrils?,0
"Okay, I start jogging backwards.",1
Can I sneak attack while prone?,2
Them I'm going to cast Lightning Bolt at him.,0
I'm gonna cast Protection from Poison on Keyleth.,0
Let's go talk to Nostoc.,1
Why have you summoned us here?,3
"Is it to tell us information about what just came out of your mine, I hope.",3
"Speaking of outsiders, you wouldn't happen to have seen a Lady Kima, would you?",3
"Sorry, what was his name again?",2
Will we get paid for the monsters and creatures we've already slayed?,2
How old is Nostoc?,2
"Yeah, we'll go with her.",1
Hi. You must be Hieris?,3
So this has been happening for quite a while?,3
And what kind of monsters have you been dealing with?,3
Let's go get drunk and go to sleep then.,1
"We go back to the Iron Hearth Tavern, right?",1
What time is it?,2
"""Oh, is everything open?",2
Do we get potions and stuff somewhere?,2
Where do we item up?,2
"I walk back to the door, because we're all just standing outside the door.",1
Are businesses open at the moment?,3
Do you know what hour it is?,3
Are the stores open at the moment?,2
How much time do we have left?,2
Let's go shopping.,1
"Before he does that, I cast prestidigitation, and I clean it up real quick.",0
"If there's anything wrong, just write the message on this, and we'll come help.",3
How many pages is that scroll?,2
I think I will go with him just to keep him from setting fire to the entire city.,1
I'm gonna go ahead and turn into a squirrel and hide in your pocket.,0
"Okay, so we're going to House Thunderbeards?",1
Can we see any traps or glyphs that are active?,2
"Can we look around and see if there's any way to, a bell to ring that's outside of that area.",2
"Can I do a nature check to see what light source is making all this grass grow, or if it's like magical growing?",2
Is there a front door?,2
"I'm gonna use my rogue abilities to walk up to the front door, and knock on it.",0
Can I see if I detect a bell?,2
I'm gonna cast Dispel Magic on the runestone.,0
Let's both fly to the door.,1
"""Well, it's a pleasure to meet you.",3
"My name's Tiberius Stormwind, and these are my friends.",3
I'm gonna cast Alter Self on myself to be a dwarf.,0
"Thank you, Lord Thunderclap.",3
"Yes, let's go buy some potions.",1
It's a beautiful shop you have.,3
It's so startling to find an elven establishment here in the middle of Kraghammer.,3
We're in the market for some healing potions to start with.,3
"Level three for this one, please.",3
"I say, you're one of the most charming people we've met so far down here.",3
I look around for something that can look like a pillow for him.,2
So we head down to the mines.,1
"Oh yeah, can I look around?",2
"I just wanna see if there's anything familiar about the markings, if I can identify any signs of something mystical that's come through here.",2
I'm gonna look for tracks.,2
I want to detect magic for a while.,2
"Are we still in the dwarven carved out, sort of structure portion of the mine.",2
"Let's go further, all the way down.",1
Let's go down.,1
Can I look for goblin tracks down here and follow those?,2
Let's go down where it's dangerous.,1
Can we see?,2
Can we ask one of the guards?,2
Is it black or is it dim?,2
Does it look like they struggled?,2
Are there any scratch marks or anything like that on the walls?,2
We go further.,1
At no point does it look like the bodies ever moved?,2
But there are the drag marks all the way?,2
Are there any drafts?,2
Do I feel any wind flows or anything like that?,2
"Am I over here, or am I over here?",2
"Do we perceive anything in here with us before going that far in, yes?",2
What direction is it coming from?,2
Is the light coming from over the water?,2
The twins will creep forward.,1
"While he does that, I'm gonna go ahead and turn into a cave bear.",0
Can I stealth against the other wall?,2
What are they?,2
Do they respond to vibration?,2
Can we remember with investigation or insight?,2
I am going to shoot the one.,0
I'm gonna take a step back behind Trinket.,1
And I sing my counter-charm song.,0
I'll just throw a healing word to him.,0
"I can pull my gun and just take a shot, right?",0
I'm just gonna take one more shot at him really quick.,0
But I'm gonna throw up a fog cloud.,0
"But it screws our vision, though, doesn't it?",2
"Nevermind, I'm just gonna do a full round of attacks.",0
I'm gonna swivel my daggers around and just stab it in the face.,0
I'm gonna stab him in the face twice.,0
I would like to go into a frenzied rage.,0

"I will just step forward a little,",1
I will cast polymorph on our big friend that we're surrounding.,0
I'm gonna take one of my two actions to clear my gun.,0
I'm gonna take a fire shot.,0
I'm shooting our friend over there.,0
I'm taking him underwater.,0
Can I cast a concentration spell on myself?,2
And then I throw him into the waterfall.,0
And run up behind the shithead who's fucking with Keyleth.,1
"Well let's stab him in the ass then, right.",0
I walk up and try to help Keyleth out of the water.,0
I'm gonna attack it. WIth some arrows.,0
And I'm gonna cast lightning bolt at the thing.,0
"Taking my shot, I'm averting my eyes, so.",0
I'm gonna go ahead and also do a call lighting spell.,0
"I just lay my hands on him, and I cast Cure Wounds in a level 2 spot.",0
I cast prestidigitation and clean everybody up.,0
"I'm unscathed, so I run after Grog, just to give him backup if he needs.",1
"No, look and search around and see what's in the bedding.",2
"I'm gonna move over here, stealthily.",1
"I see, how tall is that?",2
I'll just cast stoneskin on myself.,0
I'm gonna run over.,1
Can I see anything from that point?,2
"All right, I'll run in further.",1
I'm gonna try to stealth as I'm going in.,0
